1. Project name and introduction
 For the task of classifying Alzheimer's disease in a complex context, We propose a Multimodal Classification of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Attention Network (KAGAN). The idea is to propose a new multimodal feature generation and fusion method that uses multilevel network interaction to improve classification accuracy.
